So the Dist which was shared in assignment is not working properly as there is some issue in start script.

So I created a folder called client and added all my code.

So if you go to Formcomponent.js you will see all the logic created for form to render and submit the form. The POST Call is also added to handleSubmit function.

The GET call what you shared in assignment is not giving any response. So for now I hard coded the form values.

RUN: To run this use go to client folder npm install and npm start to show and submit the form.
